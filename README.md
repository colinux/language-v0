# Language-v0

(If you are not an Imparato developer or contributor, this grammar is of no interest to you, except to serve as Atom grammar example.)

## Installation

## Usage

Source files must have the `.v0.txt` extension and should have been saved at least 1 time in the editor (trailing whitespace removal have been enabled for this extension).
